RECENT DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS	

SQL and NoSQL	Jun 2017 – Aug 2017
•	Used MongoDB NoSQL database through 2 most useful business domain example datasets i.e., Geocodes and e-Commerce Retail. For Geocodes, computed a final result of most densely populated areas and then plotting them onto the Google Maps using the Google API and automated the overall pipeline using a shell-script. For e-Commerce Retail, computed the information by analyzing some customer and orders information by using the aggregation framework from MongoDB.

Cloud Computing	Jan 2017 – May 2017
•	Implemented a Search engine in Hadoop using MapReduce framework. Built this project for a clueWeb09 dataset as a part of 3 sub-projects;
Sub-Project-1: Write an HBase WordCount program to count all unique terms' occurrences from the clueWeb09 dataset.
Sub-Project-2: Write an HBase FreqIndexBuilder program to build an inverted index table which has the unique term's occurrences in all documents from the clueWeb09 dataset.
Sub-Project-3: Finally used output HBase tables created using Sub-Project-1 and Sub-Project-2 as sources to build overall SEARCH ENGINE functionality.

Management Access and Use of Big Data	Nov 2016 – Dec 2016
•	Involved in a PROJECT where we had to create a database of books and learn how to analyze and visualize their text. In-particular, learnt the techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to automatically discover the characters in a book, quantify the strength of relationship between them, find the important characters, identify groupings between them, and finally, create a visualization of our analyses. What we did was:
o	Download a book from Project Gutenberg and import it into MongoDB.
o	Use Python and its Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) library to extract a list of characters the book.
o	Learn how to process the text of the book to create a network of relationships between the characters.
o	Learn a couple common ways to analyze a network using network science tools.
o	Visualize the character relationships using the Gephi graph visualization platform.
Python	Aug 2017 – Dec 2017
•	Learnt the Basic python libraries and their usages.
•	Implement “k-means” algorithm for Wisconsin Breast Cancer data using Python.

Introduction to Statistics in R	May 2018 – Aug 2018
•	Covered the basic concepts of statistical inference through a careful study of several important procedures. Topics include Discrete and Continuous random variables, Estimation, Hypothesis testing, 1- and 2-sample location Problems, ANOVA, ARIMA and simple Linear Regression. At a high level performed;

o	Characterize uncertainty and variation using probability
o	Summarize data using computer graphics and numerical measures of center, spread, and association
o	Assess whether observed data fits a probability model and understand the implications for analysis
o	Explain what significance probabilities (P-value) and confidence intervals mean, and identify common misinterpretations
o	Compare two or more samples or sets of measurements to draw scientific conclusions
o	Apply statistical models to real data and recognize their uses and limitations

Applied machine learning in Python	Aug 2018 – Dec 2018
•	Learn and Implement different ML algorithms using Python libraries like numpy, pandasm scikit and are currently learning to implement different ML algorithms which includes;
o	KNN (Image Classification and KNN Housing Price, Linear and Logit Regression) 
o	GridSearchCV and Cross Value fold validation and benefit
o	Gradient Descent and Newton Raphson Optimization to find Local Min and Max.
o	Linear Regression, Polynomial regression
o	Feature selection, Sequential backward Selection, Regularization Lasso, Ridge and Elastic-Net regression
o	Pipelining
o	Naïve Bayes for classification, understood Bayesian networks and how it works to calibrate different probabilistic models.

               Using all the above and predicting models for different use cases. So far have completed 2 mini Kaggle projects;
o	CIFAR image classification competition, which involved many concepts like pipelining, KNNClassifier,GridSearch,Cross-Val-Score, feature selection together for the final model.
o	Bike Rental Regression competition, which involved using pipelining, standardizing, Linear Regressor, GridsearchCv, feature selection using different penalty like Lasso or Ridge Or SelectKBest etc together to predict the best model.
o	With all these we calculated 3 matrixes of scores which were MAE, MAPE, RMSE and based on RMSE results we finalized the best model.
o	Tested model using the commonly available Datasets like IRIS, Boston-Housing etc. and depict different version of predictions etc.
              And, some other which I have covered are;
o	Decision Trees, EM, SVM, K-Means, PCA, SVD etc.

Deep Learning	Jan 2019 – Apr 2019

•	Understand the single and multilayer Neural Network and how the different activation and gradient algorithms operate.
•	Type of common Activation Functions like ReLU, TanH, Sigmoid etc.
•	Build a multi-Layer Neural Network using TensorFlow on Google Colab for a MNIST dataset, Audio files etc
•	CNN, working on understanding how the Convolutional NN (CNN)  is different from Fully connected Deep NN (DNN).
•	How the Recurrent Neural Network is more reliable for Continuous data like Audi file, time series etc.
•	Siamese network and its usage for Speech denoising input data (regression task) and Image classification task.

Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles	May 2019 – Aug 2019
	
This course aims at covering a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. We'll interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)―all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA. The primary focus of the course will be to learn, to understand, and to develop deep learning models that can enable autonomous driving under various driving conditions. These models will tackle tasks such as vehicle control, and environment understanding.

Phase-1: Build a PID Longitudinal controller and Stanley Lateral Controller which would run the car in simulation at a certain speed.
Phase-2: Using the Reinforcement Learning to Automate the learning behavior of the Car using Deep-Q Learning algorithm.
Phase-3: Using the Deep Learning CNN architecture to Automate the learning behavior of the Car.
